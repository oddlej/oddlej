- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oddlej

- I'm learning Assembly for Arm64v8 on a Khadas Vim3 board with Ubuntu 24.04 (for now) and having a blast. I'm also putting some time into C++, and a folder to put some HTML, PHP, Javascript, CSS code etc. And I'd like to experiment with some sample libraries on here. This is where I'll put my repos. Cheers.
